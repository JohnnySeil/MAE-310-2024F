1. Run 'square.m' first and import the mesh and related data form gmsh where we did the mesh generation.
2. Run 'proj_driver' to do the main calculation and visualization. 
  At Line 223, we can replace 'stress22' to do different visualiztion. (Only for plane strain and stress)
for displacement visualization, we can use the code from line 225 to 228.
3. Run 'errors' to calculate two types of errors.
4. Run 'hole_driver' to deal with the problem on plane with a circular hole.
